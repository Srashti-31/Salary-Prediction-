# Salary-Prediction-
For this project, I have examined the Census Income data set available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository named Adult Data set. The ML model predict whether an individualâ€™s income will be greater than $50,000 per year based on several attributes from the census data.

## About Project
This notebook have done analysis on salary prediction from the data provided by UCI machine learning repository.
The project aims to predict whether the salary of a person is above or below or equal to 50k.
The orginal data was modified, analyzed, changed, corrected and cleaned.
Some of the features were removed from the data and rest were used in this notebook for better accuracy.
The features used are mentioned below:
1)age: continuous. (Age of an individual)
2)capital-loss: continuous.
3)fnlwgt: continuous. (this is the number of people the census believes the entry represents)
4)education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool. (highest level of education achieved by an individual)
5)education-num: continuous. (education level in numeric form)
6)marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.
7)hours-per-week: continuous. (the hours an individual has reported to work per week)
8)relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.
